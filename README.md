# Just a Comic Reader

Hello, this is a capstone project for a module I took. It retrieves comic pages from XKCD and display them.

It is using HTML, CSS and plain Javascript

## Installation

Just open the HTML file and you are in!

Alternatively, use [this link](https://raw.githack.com/junhuitan2017/ComicReader/main/manga.html) to view the site directly!

## Usage

There is a input to navigate to sepcific page and a dropdown to specify the number of comics to display at once

Below them are the buttons for navigation through different pages

Click on the comic to zoom in
